# stock-trading-news-alert

This project aims to give you news alert when a certain large cap stock price rise/drop by a large percentage(5%), three text message will be sent to you including the news' title and a brief description.

To get stock price data, I used a free Time Series Stock Data APIs: https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily.
To get news related to a certain stock, I used the New Price API:https://newsapi.org/.

Note that I used Twilio to send SMS messages.
